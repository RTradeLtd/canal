canal - VPN Auto-Configuration Tool
===================================

This plugin encapsulates commands for configuring a VPN as the default route
on straightforward client applications, or forwarding to another connection on
a server.

        Usage of ./canal:
          -gate string
             Gateway to forward traffic to (default "192.168.99.1")
          -server
             Configure a server (default false)
          -tun string
             Name of the tunnel to auto-configure (default "tun0")

It is considerably less likely to destroy things you love now, but it probably
still needs to be smarter than it is.
